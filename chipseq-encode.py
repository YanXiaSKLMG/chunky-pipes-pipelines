# Step 0: FastQC
# Step 1a: Align with BWA, both SE and PE
# Step 1b: Post-alignment filtering
# Step 2a: Convert BAM to tagAlign, BED 3+3, both SE and PE
# Step 2b: Calculate cross-correlation QC scores
# Step 2c: Generate self-pseudoreplicates for each replicate, both SE and PE
# Step 2d: Generate pooled dataset and pooled-pseudoreplicates
