ChunkyPipes Pipelines
=====================

This repository exists so I can version control pipelines I use for various projects in the White Lab. They're
not guaranteed in any way to work or be up to date, though it's unlikely I would commit something that's
obviously broken.

All pipelines are formatted to run with the `ChunkyPipes <https://github.com/djf604/chunky-pipes>`_ framework.
